# ft_transcendence
This project is an integral part of the 42Lisboa curriculum and aims to create a web application that allows users to register, log in, add friends, chat, play Pong, and participate in tournaments.
In this project, we have the flexibility to choose from multiple modules to build the application. Detailed information about each module is available in the projectâ€™s subject. Below, there is a section listing all the chosen [modules](#modules).

For more info see the [subject](https://github.com/dspereira/42Cursus-transcendence/blob/improve-readme/en.subject.pdf).

## Installation / Usage
Here you will find instructions to start this project in `Shell` for Unix systems.

This project runs on `Docker`. To use it, you need to install Docker. See the documentation [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### Clone repo:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:dspereira/42Cursus-transcendence.git transcendence && cd transcendence
```

### Setting Up Environment Variables:
Before running the project, create a `.env` file in the root directory and fill it with the required environment variables, as outlined in this [documentation](https://github.com/dspereira/42Cursus-transcendence/blob/improve-readme/env.md).
```shell
touch .env
```

### Build:
```shell
make
```

### Usage
You can access the app by navigating to `https://DOMAIN:PORT` (where `DOMAIN` and `PORT` are configured in the `.env` file).  
**Example:**  
`https://localhost:8443/`

Since we are using OpenSSL, your certificate is self-signed, which may trigger a privacy and security warning in your browser. If this occurs, you will need to click on the option to "accept and continue" or a similar prompt, depending on the browser you are using.
