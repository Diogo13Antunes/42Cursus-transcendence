# ft_transcendence
This project is an integral part of the 42Lisboa curriculum and aims to create a web application that allows users to register, log in, add friends, chat, play Pong, and participate in tournaments.
In this project, we have the flexibility to choose from multiple modules to build the application. Detailed information about each module is available in the projectâ€™s subject. Below, there is a section listing all the chosen [modules](#modules).

For more info see the [subject](https://github.com/dspereira/42Cursus-transcendence/blob/main/en.subject.pdf).

## Application Architecture
<img src="https://github.com/dspereira/42Cursus-transcendence/blob/main/architecture-schema.jpg" alt="Application Architecture" width="900"/>

### NGINX - Reverse Proxy
This container operates an HTTP server powered by [NGINX](https://nginx.org/en/), serving as a Reverse Proxy. Its primary role is to handle incoming client requests, distributing them to the backend or frontend services as needed. This setup enhances security, and allows for centralized management of incoming traffic by forwarding requests to appropriate application servers based on predefined rules.
The reverse proxy acts as a single entry point between our Docker services and the external network, facilitating secure and efficient communication.

### Django - API Server
This container hosts a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) application that serves a REST-like API to handle all frontend requests, processes them, and returns the appropriate responses. Acting as the main interface between the frontend and the database, it manages data retrieval, creation, and updates. This setup ensures efficient communication and a smooth data flow throughout the application.

### NGINX - SPA Server
This container hosts a [NGINX](https://nginx.org/en/) server for host a static files of the SPA. For this project was created a SPA Aplication in vanila JavaScript, using the [webcomponents](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) to create reusable components. All routing and history management are handled in vanilla JavaScript, which updates the main <div> with the appropriate page component. Each page component is built using custom components to minimize code repetition and enhance maintainability.

### Database

## Installation / Usage
Here you will find instructions to start this project in `Shell` for Unix systems.

This project runs on `Docker`. To use it, you need to install Docker. See the documentation [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### Clone repo:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:dspereira/42Cursus-transcendence.git transcendence && cd transcendence
```

### Setting Up Environment Variables:
Before running the project, create a `.env` file in the root directory and fill it with the required environment variables, as outlined in this [documentation](https://github.com/dspereira/42Cursus-transcendence/blob/main/env.md).
```shell
touch .env
```

### Build:
```shell
make
```

### Usage
You can access the app by navigating to `https://DOMAIN:PORT` (where `DOMAIN` and `PORT` are configured in the `.env` file).  
**Example:**  
`https://localhost:8443/`

Since we are using OpenSSL, your certificate is self-signed, which may trigger a privacy and security warning in your browser. If this occurs, you will need to click on the option to "accept and continue" or a similar prompt, depending on the browser you are using.
